### Update

You can always check our [releases page](https://github.com/utrustdev/utrust-for-magento2/releases) for a new version. You can update by following the same instructions as installing.

### Uninstall (without Composer)

If [removing with Composer](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-uninstall-mods.html) doesn't work (which is recommended), you can try to remove it manually:

```
bin/magento module:disable Utrust_Payment
bin/magento setup:upgrade
rm -rf app/code/Utrust
bin/magento cache:clean
bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f
```

3. On the left sidebar choose _Integrations_.
4. Select _Magento 2_ and click the button _Generate Credentials_.
5. You will see now your `Api Key` and `Webhook Secret`, save them somewhere safe temporarily.

   :warning: You will only be able to see the `Webhook Secret` once, after refreshing or changing page it will be no longer available to copy; if needed, you can always generate new credentials.

   :no_entry_sign: Don't share your credentials with anyone. They can use it to place orders **on your behalf**.

### On the Magento side

1. Go to your Magento admin dashboard.
2. Navigate to _Stores -> Configuration -> Sales -> Payment Methods -> Utrust_.
3. Add your `Api Key` and `Webhook Secret` and click "Save Config" button on top.

## Contribute

This plugin was initially written by a third-party contractor (Moisés Sequeira from [CloudInfo](https://cloudinfo.pt/)), and is now maintained by the Utrust development team.

We have now opened it to the world so that the community using this plugin may have the chance of shaping its development.

You can contribute by simply letting us know your suggestions or any problems that you find [by opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/utrustdev/utrust-for-magento2/issues/new).

You can also fork the repository on GitHub and open a pull request for the `master` branch with your missing features and/or bug fixes.
Please make sure the new code follows the same style and conventions as already written code.
Our team is eager to welcome new contributors into the mix :blush:.

### Development

If you want to get your hands dirty and make your own changes to the Utrust for Magento plugin, we recommend you to install it in a local Magento store (either directly on your computer or using a virtual host) so you can make the changes in a controlled environment.
Alternatively, you can also do it in a Magento online store that you have for testing/staging.

Once the plugin is installed in your store, the source code should be in `app/code/Utrust/Payment/`. All the changes there should be reflected live in the store (if it doesn't, go to _System -> Cache Management_ and flush the cache).
If something goes wrong with the module, logs can be found in `var/log/utrust.log`.

## Publishing

For now only members of the Utrust development team can publish new versions of the Utrust for Magento 2 plugin.
